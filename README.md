Shell scripts for controlling AWS EC2.

## What's this?

I originally wrote these scripts for easily controlling remote EC2 instances via my local machines and routers. You can use the scripts to launch or shutdown instances, while use some 'apps' to do cool stuff such as creating sock5 tunnel, http proxy, VPN and downloading/uploading files ...

## Source Code

The source code was pushed to the `dev` branch. You have to modify the code in order to use in your machine.

## Platform

The scripts were developed on Macs and tested most of them on Linux.

My router runs `Buzybox`.
